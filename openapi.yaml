  title: Insights Scheduler API
  description: |
    A job scheduling service that allows users to create, manage, and execute scheduled jobs.

    The service implements a functional core/imperative shell architecture pattern with:
    - Pure business logic in the core domain layer
    - Side effects handled in the shell layer
    - Support for multiple payload types (message, HTTP request, command, export)
    - Multi-tenant support with organization-level isolation

    ## Authentication
    All endpoints require Red Hat identity authentication via the `X-Rh-Identity` header.

    ## Schedule Format
    Jobs can be scheduled using standard 5-field cron expressions:
    - Format: `minute hour day month weekday`

    Common predefined schedules:
    - Every 10 minutes: `*/10 * * * *`
    - Every hour: `0 * * * *`
    - Every day: `0 0 * * *`
    - Every month: `0 0 1 * *`
  version: 1.0.0
